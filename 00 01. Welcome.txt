Hi. I'm Simon Allardice, and welcome to Foundations of Programming: Object-Oriented Design. This course exists because everyone who learns to program hits the same wall. First, you get through the fundamentals, the basic syntax of a programming language. You learn how to write some code. But soon you realize there's a huge difference between being able to write a few lines of code and being able to design, understand, and create a more complex application. And often it's difficult to even know where to start. Well, this is where object- oriented design can help.

But to discuss these ideas we're going to need a vocabulary, the jargon, the terminology, the words we use, so that when we talk about this we know exactly what we're talking about. And we'll see the process of taking an initial idea for an application, something you'd write on the back of a napkin and understanding how to break it apart into the right pieces, so that we end up knowing exactly what code to go and write. And we'll also see the basics of UML, or the Unified Modeling Language. This is one useful way of diagramming, of sketching visual models of an object-oriented system.

Now we won't be writing any code in this course. As you'll see, we won't have to. But you will see examples of how the most popular languages put these ideas into practice. So we've got a lot to cover. Let's get started!
